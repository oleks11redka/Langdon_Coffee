              Langdon Coffee Merchants source green beans from some of the worldâ€™s most exciting and XXX coffee origins.
              Right across the bean belt, we offer roasters a broad selection of traceable (back to the mill, at a minimum) cultivars,
              processing methods and flavour profiles, meeting the needs of speciality and high-end commercial quality coffee roasters in the UK,
              New Zealand and Australia. All our beans are extensively cupped for quality assurance at our state-of-the art laboratory in Melbourne
              by a Q-grader before making their way to our customers. As well as single origin beans, we offer commercial blending for that discerning,
              bespoke taste
